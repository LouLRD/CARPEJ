        <p>Did you knew that all the backgrounds that you have seen since the beginning are actually spaces that I created with Blender ? They are just tests for the moment because I am just starting out but they sum up my interest in this software. I really like these renderings at the limit of realism, colored where we find a new place! Moreover, I find them zen and relaxing.</p>
