        <p>The subject of artificial intelligence is something that intrigues me. I know today that even if I wanted to code one, I wouldn't be able to. That said, what is artificial intelligence? It is a program that has a particular task to which examples are given and that can then face new images because it will have learned to perform its task thanks to the examples. If we decide to make a program that has to recognize cars in an image, we provide it with two folders: a folder with cars and a folder without cars. After storing the information it will be able to analyze an image that is not part of the previous selection and tell if there is a car or not in the image. Moreover, the program will have learned from this operation and its next "decisions" will then be more and more accurate. Anyway, I'm getting away from the subject, what I'm really interested in is the generation of text (did you know that some of the sentences in the biography part was generated by AI?) or image.</p>
