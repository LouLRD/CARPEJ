        <p class="bio">I'm Lou, I am a 20 year old artist (and somewhat of a musician). I use 3D modeling software to create digital art and am currently working on works based on artificial intelligence, aesthetics and new technologies. I'm very interested in software like Blender that allows me to create realistic scenes that can come straight out of my imagination without necessarily needing to resort to monumental backgrounds in physical reality. I also try to create a dialogue between some of my creations and the progressive language of A.I., such as machine learning, which means that code is, like humans, constantly evolving and learning. Although these are very controversial topics and works in the contemporary art world for many reasons that I will not develop here, I remain convinced that art can evolve in many ways and that all its ramifications can coexist and even make sense. At least I hope so.</p>
